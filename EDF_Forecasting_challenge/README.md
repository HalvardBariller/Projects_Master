# Load Forecasting During the COVID Period
## Day ahead forecasting of electricity load from April 2020 to January 2021

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has urged many governments in the world to enforce a strict lockdown where all nonessential businesses are closed and citizens are ordered to stay at home. One of the consequences of this policy is a significant change in electricity consumption patterns. Since load forecasting models rely on calendar or meteorological information and are trained on historical data, they fail to capture the significant break caused by the lockdown and have exhibited poor performances since the beginning of the pandemic. The proposed challenge aims at improving forecasts during this period by proposing new methods but also new open data.

Data are taken from http://www.rte-france.com/fr/eco2mix/eco2mix Licence Ouverte v2.0 (Etalab) and https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker#data


This project was undertaken with √Ångel REYERO LOBO, and won the challenge proposed as part of the Predictive Modelling course given by the Pr. Yanig GOUDE (Senior Researcher, EDF R&D).

The functions have been encoded as an R library named 'ProjectLoadForecasting'.
The trained models have been saved separately.

Dataset Description:
The data correspond to french electricity load from 20212 to january 2021 at a daily resolution (mean per day) in MW. We provide a train set from january 2012 to august 2019 and a test set from september 2019 to january 2021. The goal of the challenge is to forecast the target "Load".

File descriptions:
