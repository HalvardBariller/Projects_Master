# Introduction to Unsupervised Learning


Silva et al proposed morphological features to characterise tree leaves. The 'Leaf' dataset is a dataset from which the processed data in the original paper is extracted.
The aim is to study this dataset from an unsupervised learning point of view, and to look at the efficiency of an automatic annotation from this data by comparing different (unsupervised) methods.

This project was undertaken with Alex PIERRON as part of an introductory course on Unsupervised Learning given by the Pr. Christine KERIBIN.
