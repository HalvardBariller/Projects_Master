# Numerical Optimisation - Optimal Transport


This project aims at introducing the basic concepts of discrete Optimal Transport by considering a problem of pastries' deliveries between bakeries and restaurants. The overall quantity produced is equal to the one consumed, we thus look for an optimal coupling for deliveries relying on a given cost matrix.
It is structured in four parts:
- Monge-Kantorovich problem from a linear programming approach
- Dual problem and log-sum-exp function
- Entropic regularisation and Sinkhorn algorithm
- Geodesics and Wasserstein flow


This project was undertaken with Virgile BERTRAND and Elona LAHMI as part of a course on Numerical Optimisation given by the Pr. Luca NENNA.
